# Manage subscription

## Buy a subscription

After you [create a user account](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_up) for GitLab,
you can buy a subscription for GitLab.com or GitLab Self-Managed.
The subscription determines which features are available for your private projects.

After you subscribe to GitLab, you can manage the details of your subscription.
If you experience any issues, see the [troubleshooting GitLab subscription](/subscriptions/gitlab_com/gitlab_subscription_troubleshooting/).

Organizations with public open source projects can apply to the [GitLab for Open Source program](/subscriptions/community_programs/#gitlab-for-open-source).

### For GitLab.com

- Tier: Premium, Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab.com

GitLab.com is the GitLab multi-tenant software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering.
You don’t need to install anything to use GitLab.com, you only need to [create a user account](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_up).
When you create your account, you choose:

- [A subscription](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/).
View the [GitLab.com feature comparison](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/feature-comparison/) and decide which tier you want.
- The number of seats you want.
- A GitLab Credits option.

A GitLab.com subscription applies to a top-level group. Members of every subgroup and project in the group:

- Can use the features of the subscription.
- Consume seats in the subscription.

If a user views or selects a different top-level group (one they have created themselves, for example) and that group does not have a paid subscription, the user does not see any of the paid features.

A user can belong to two different top-level groups with different subscriptions. In this case, the user sees only the features available to that subscription.

To subscribe to GitLab.com:

1. In the top bar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.
2. In the left sidebar, select **Settings** > **Billing**.
3. Select **Upgrade subscription**.
4. Select a tier and a GitLab Credits option.
5. Select **Continue to checkout**. You are redirected to the Customers Portal.

If you’re purchasing a subscription for an existing **Free** GitLab Self-Managed
instance, ensure you’re purchasing enough seats to
[cover your users](/administration/admin_area/#administering-users).

## Activate subscription

After you buy a subscription:

- [Sales team](https://customers.gitlab.com/contact_us) if you need help renewing your subscription.

### Check when subscription expires

15 days before a subscription expires, a banner with the subscription expiry date displays for administrators in the GitLab user interface.

You cannot manually renew your subscription more than 15 days before the subscription expires. To check when you can renew:

1. Sign in to the [Customers Portal](https://customers.gitlab.com/customers/sign_in).
2. Select **Subscription actions** (  ), then select **Renew subscription** to view the date you can renew.

### Renew automatically

Prerequisites:

- For GitLab Self-Managed, you must synchronize subscription data and review your account at least two days before renewal to ensure your changes are synchronized.

When a subscription is set to auto-renew, it renews automatically at midnight UTC on the expiration date without a gap in available service. You receive email notifications before a subscription automatically renews.

Seat counts do not decrease automatically at renewal time. If you have more billable users than your current subscription quantity at renewal time, your seat count increases automatically to match the current number of users in your
[group](/subscriptions/manage_seats/#view-seat-usage) or [instance](/administration/moderate_users/#view-users).
To avoid unexpectedly renewing your subscription for more seats, learn how to renew for fewer seats.

Subscriptions purchased through the Customers Portal are set to auto-renew by default.
The renewal setting is displayed by the subscription, on the **Subscriptions & purchases** page:

- **Auto-renews on DATE**: The subscription renews automatically.
- **Expires on DATE**: The subscription does not renew automatically.

#### Turn off automatic subscription renewal

To turn off automatic subscription renewal:

1. Sign in to the [Customers Portal](https://customers.gitlab.com/customers/sign_in).
2. Go to the **Subscriptions & purchases** page.
3. By the relevant subscription, select **Subscription actions** (  ) > **Cancel subscription**.
4. From the **Why do you want to cancel?** dropdown list, select a reason.
5. Optional. In the **Would you like to add anything?** text box, enter any relevant information.
6. Select **Cancel subscription**.

Your subscription remains active until the end of the current term, and then expires.

#### Turn on automatic subscription renewal

To turn on automatic subscription renewal:

1. Sign in to the [Customers Portal](https://customers.gitlab.com/customers/sign_in).
2. Go to the **Subscriptions & purchases** page.
3. By the relevant subscription, select **Subscription actions** (  ) > **Turn on auto-renew**.

### Renew manually

To manually renew your subscription:

1. Determine the number of users you need in the next subscription period.
2. Sign in to the [Customers Portal](https://customers.gitlab.com/customers/sign_in).
3. Under your existing subscription, select **Start renewal**. This button does not display
until 15 days before the subscription expires.
4. If renewing Premium or Ultimate products, in the **Seats** text box, enter the
total number of user seats you need for the upcoming year.
Make sure this number is equal to, or greater than
the number of [billable users](/subscriptions/manage_seats/#billable-users) in the system at the time of renewal.
5. Optional. For GitLab Self-Managed, if the maximum number of users in your instance exceeded the number
you were licensed for in the previous subscription term, the
[overage](/subscriptions/quarterly_reconciliation/) is due when you renew.
In the **Users over license** text box, enter the number of [users over subscription](/subscriptions/manage_seats/#users-over-subscription-limit) for the user overage incurred.
6. Optional. If renewing add-on products, review and update the desired quantity. You can also remove products.
7. Optional. If upgrading the subscription tier, select the desired option.
8. Review your renewal details and select **Renew subscription** to complete the
payment process.
9. For GitLab Self-Managed, on the [Subscriptions & purchases](https://customers.gitlab.com/subscriptions) page by the relevant subscription, select **Copy activation code** to get
a copy of the renewal term activation code, and [add the activation code](/administration/license/) to your instance.

To add products to your subscription, [contact the sales team](https://customers.gitlab.com/contact_us).

### Renew for fewer seats

Subscription renewals with fewer seats must have or exceed the current number of billable users.

Before you renew your subscription:

- For GitLab.com, [reduce the number of billable users](/subscriptions/manage_seats/#remove-users-from-subscription) if it exceeds the number of seats you want to renew for.
- For GitLab Self-Managed, [block inactive or unwanted users](/administration/moderate_users/#block-a-user).

To manually renew your subscription for fewer seats, you can either:

- Manually renew within 15 days of the subscription renewal date. Ensure that you specify the seat quantity when you renew.
- Turn off automatic renewal of your subscription,
and contact the [sales team](https://customers.gitlab.com/contact_us) to renew it for the number of seats you want.

### Renewal notifications

15 days before a subscription automatically renews, an email is sent with information about the renewal.

- If your credit card is expired, the email tells you how to update it.
- If you have any outstanding overages or your subscription can’t automatically renew for any other reason, the email tells you to contact our Sales team or manually renew in the Customers Portal.
- If there are no issues, the email specifies the:
  - Names and quantity of the products being renewed.
  - Total amount you owe. If your usage increases before renewal, this amount changes.

### Manage renewal invoice

An invoice is generated for your renewal. To view or download this renewal invoice,
go to the [Customers Portal invoices page](https://customers.gitlab.com/invoices).

If your account has a [saved credit card](/subscriptions/billing_account/#change-your-payment-method),
the card is charged for the invoice amount.

If a payment cannot be processed or the auto-renewal fails for any other reason, you have 14 days to renew your subscription, after which your GitLab tier is downgraded.

## Expired subscription

Subscriptions expire at the start of the expiration date, 00:00 server time.

For example, if a subscription is valid from January 1, 2024 until January 1, 2025:

- It expires at 11:59:59 PM UTC December 31, 2024.
- It is considered expired from 12:00:00 AM UTC January 1, 2025.

If your subscription has expired, you can still renew it manually within 15 days after the expiration date. After 15 days, the manual renewal option is no longer available and you must purchase a new subscription to restore access to paid features.

### For GitLab.com

- Tier: Premium, Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab.com

When your subscription expires, paid features are no longer available. However, you can continue to use free features. To resume paid feature functionality, renew your subscription.

### For GitLab Self-Managed

- Tier: Premium, Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab Self-Managed

When your license expires:

- Your instance becomes read-only.
- GitLab locks features, such as Git pushes and issue creation.
- An expiration message is displayed to all instance administrators.

After your license has expired:

- To resume functionality,
[activate a new subscription](/administration/license_file/#activate-subscription-during-installation).
- To keep using Free tier features only,
[remove the expired license](/administration/license_file/#remove-a-license).

## Subscription data synchronization

- Tier: Premium, Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab Self-Managed

Prerequisites:

- GitLab Enterprise Edition (EE).
- Connection to the internet, and must not have an offline environment.
- [Activated](/administration/license/) your instance with an activation code.

Your subscription data is automatically synchronized once a day between your GitLab Self-Managed instance and GitLab.

At approximately 3:00 AM (UTC), this daily synchronization job sends subscription data to the Customers Portal. For this reason, updates and renewals might not apply immediately.

The data is sent securely through an encrypted HTTPS connection to
`customers.gitlab.com` on port `443`. If the job fails, it retries up to 12 times
over approximately 17 hours.

After you have set up automatic data synchronization, the following processes are also automated.

- [Quarterly subscription reconciliation](/subscriptions/quarterly_reconciliation/).
- Subscription renewals.
- Subscription updates, such as adding more seats or upgrading a GitLab tier.

### Manually synchronize subscription data

Prerequisites:

- Administrator access.

You can also manually synchronize subscription data at any time.

1. In the upper-right corner, select **Admin**.
2. In the left sidebar, select **Subscription**.
3. In the **Subscription details** section, select **Sync** (  ).

A synchronization job is then queued. When the job finishes, the subscription details are updated.

### Subscription data

The daily synchronization job sends the following information to the Customers Portal:

- Date
- Timestamp
- License key, with the following encrypted within the key:
  - Company name
  - Licensee name
  - Licensee email
- Historical [maximum user count](/subscriptions/manage_seats/#self-managed-billing-and-usage)
- [Billable users count](/subscriptions/manage_seats/#billable-users)
- GitLab version
- Hostname
- Instance ID
- Unique instance ID

Additionally, you get add-on metrics such as:

- Add-on type
- Purchased seats
- Assigned seats

Example of a license sync request:

```
{
  "gitlab_version": "14.1.0-pre",
  "timestamp": "2021-06-14T12:00:09Z",
  "date": "2021-06-14",
  "license_key": "XXX",
  "max_historical_user_count": 75,
  "billable_users_count": 75,
  "hostname": "gitlab.example.com",
  "instance_id": "9367590b-82ad-48cb-9da7-938134c29088",
  "unique_instance_id": "a98bab6e-73e3-5689-a487-1e7b89a56901",
  "add_on_metrics": [
    {
      "add_on_type": "duo_enterprise",
      "purchased_seats": 100,
      "assigned_seats": 50
    }
  ]
}
```
## Link subscription to a group

- Tier: Premium, Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab.com

Prerequisites:

- A group namespace.

Only one group namespace can be linked to a subscription.

If your Premium or Ultimate subscription is on a personal namespace, before linking your subscription, you should either:

- [Transfer your project](/user/project/working_with_projects/#transfer-a-project) to a group.
- [Convert your personal namespace to a group](/tutorials/convert_personal_namespace_to_group/) to preserve your existing URL.

To link your subscription to a group or change the group linked to a GitLab.com subscription:

1. Sign in to the [Customers Portal](https://customers.gitlab.com/customers/sign_in) with a [linked](/subscriptions/billing_account/#link-a-gitlabcom-account) GitLab.com account.
2. Do one of the following: 
  - If the subscription is not linked to a group, select **Link subscription to a group**.
  - If the subscription is already linked to a group, select **Subscription actions** (  ) > **Change linked group**.
3. Select the desired group from the **New Namespace** dropdown list. For a group to appear here, you must have the Owner role for that group.
4. If the [total number of users](/subscriptions/manage_seats/#view-seat-usage) in your group exceeds the number of seats in your subscription,
you are prompted to pay for the additional users. Subscription charges are calculated based on
the total number of users in a group, including its subgroups and nested projects.
If you purchased your subscription through an authorized reseller, you are unable to pay for additional users. You can either: 
  - Remove additional users, so that no overage is detected.
  - Contact the partner to purchase additional seats now or at the end of your subscription term.
5. Select **Confirm changes**.

For a demo, see [Linking GitLab Subscription to the Namespace](https://youtu.be/8iOsN8ajBUw).

## Add or change subscription contacts

Contacts can renew a subscription, cancel a subscription, or transfer the subscription to a different namespace.

You can [change profile owner information](/subscriptions/billing_account/#change-profile-owner-information)
and [add another billing account manager](/subscriptions/billing_account/#add-a-billing-account-manager).

### Transfer restrictions

You can change the linked namespace. However, this is not supported for all subscription types.

You cannot transfer:

- An expired or trial subscription.
- A subscription with compute minutes which is already linked to a namespace.
- A subscription with a Premium or Ultimate plan to a namespace which already has a Premium or Ultimate plan.
- A subscription with a GitLab Duo add-on to a namespace which already has a subscription with a GitLab Duo add-on.
- A subscription with a Premium or Ultimate plan to a personal namespace.
- A subscription purchased using a discount code.
